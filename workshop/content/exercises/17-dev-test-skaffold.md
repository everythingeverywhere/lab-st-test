Skaffold makes some enhacements to our development workflow when using Kubernetes
* Skaffold will
    *   Build the app and create the container (buildpacks)
    *   Push the container to the registry (Docker)
    *   Apply the deployment and service YAMLs
    *   Stream the logs from the Pod to your terminal
    *   Automatically setup port forwarding

Run the following command to begin developing with Skaffold.
```execute-1
skaffold dev --port-forward
```

### 
**Testing Everything Out**

*   If you are `watch`ing your Kubernetes resources you will see the same resources created as before
```execute-2
watch -n 1 kubectl get all
```

*   When running `skaffold dev --port-forward` you will see a line in your console that looks like

```
Port forwarding service/k8s-demo-app in namespace rbaxter, remote port 80 -> address 127.0.0.1 port 4503

```

*   In this case port `4503` will be forwarded to port `80` of the service

```
curl localhost:4503; echo
Hello World
```
