*   Skaffold also makes it easy to attach a debugger to the container running in Kubernetes


```execute-1
skaffold debug --port-forward
```

Port forwarding pod/k8s-demo-app-75d4f4b664-2jqvx in namespace rbaxter, remote port 5005 -> address 127.0.0.1 port 5005
...

```



*   The `debug` command results in two ports being forwarded
    *   The http port, `4503` in the above example
    *   The remote debug port `5005` in the above example
*   You can then setup the remote debug configuration in your IDE to attach to the process and set breakpoints just like you would if the app was running locally
*   If you set a breakpoint where we return `Hola World` from the `hello` method in `K8sDemoApplication.java` and then issue our `curl` command to hit the endpoint you should be able to step through the code
