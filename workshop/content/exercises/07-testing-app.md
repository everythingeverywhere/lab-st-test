### 
**Testing The App**



*   The service is assigned a cluster IP, which is only accessible from inside the cluster


```
NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/k8s-demo-app   ClusterIP   10.100.200.243   <none>        80/TCP    68m

```



*   To access the app we can use `kubectl port-forward`


```execute-1
kubectl port-forward service/k8s-demo-app 8080:80

```



*   Now we can `curl` localhost:8080 and it will be forwarded to the service in the cluster


```execute-2
curl http://localhost:8080
```


**Congrats you have deployed your first app to Kubernetes ðŸŽ‰**

Be sure to stop the `kubectl port-forward` process before moving on
