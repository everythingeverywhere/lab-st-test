*   We can pipe the output from `kustomize` into `kubectl` in order to use the generated YAML to deploy the app to Kubernetes


```
$ kustomize build kustomize/qa | kubectl apply -f -

```



*   If you are watching the pods in your Kubernetes namespace you will now see two pods created instead of one


```
