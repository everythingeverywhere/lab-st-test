*   Deploy the apps using Skaffold


```
$ skaffold dev --port-forward

```



*   This should deploy both the k8s-demo-app and the name-service app


```
$ kubectl get all

```



*   Because we deployed two services and supplied the `-port-forward` flag Skaffold will forward two ports


```
Port forwarding service/k8s-demo-app in namespace user1, remote port 80 -> address 127.0.0.1 port 4503
Port forwarding service/k8s-workshop-name-service in namespace user1, remote port 80 -> address 127.0.0.1 port 4504

```



*   Test the name service


```
$ curl localhost:4504; echo
John
```


Hitting the service multiple times will return a different name



*   Test the k8s-demo-app which should now make a request to the name-service


```
$ curl localhost:4503; echo
Hola John
```


Making multiple requests should result in different names coming from the name-service



*   Stop the Skaffold process to clean everything up before moving to the next step
